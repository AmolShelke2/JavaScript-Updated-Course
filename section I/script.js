// coding challenge #1

/*
Mark and john are trying to compare their 
BMI(body Mass Index), which is calculated using 
the formula; BMI = max / height ** 2 = max / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter)

1. store mark's and john's mass and height
 in variables 

2. Calculate both their BMI's using the
 formula (you can event implement both versions)

3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing 
information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John

Test Data 1: Marks weight 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.
john weight is 92 kg and 1.95 m tall .
Test Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. 
john weight 85 kg and 1.76 m tall.



const marksMass = 78;
const marksHeight = 1.69;
const johnsMass = 92;
const johnsHeight = 1.95;

const marksBMI = marksMass / (marksHeight * marksHeight);
const johnsBMI = johnsMass / (johnsHeight * johnsHeight);

console.log(
  "MarksBMI " + marksBMI + " is greater than " + "johnsBMI " + johnsBMI
);

const marksHigherBMI = marksBMI > johnsBMI;

// Coding Challenge #2

/*
Use the BMI example from challenge #1, and the code you already 
wrote, and improve it

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has 
the higher BMI, The message can be either "Mark's BMI is 
higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"

2. Use a template string include the BMI values in the outputs.
Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)"
