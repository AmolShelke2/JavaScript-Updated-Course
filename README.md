### What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a high level object-oriented multi-paradigm programming language

### JavaScript is the third main tool to make a website a website is simply create with HTML CSS and JavaScript:

- HTML is responsible for the structure of the page all websites are written in
  HTML

- CSS is known as cascading style sheets it is responsible for styling the webpage without css the website will not look good

- and JavaScript is usefull for the interactivity such as clicking a button, submitting the
  form, loading data from the servers, and then this aplication is then we called web apps and it is all we can do with the help of javaScript

### How to Link our JavaScript files and run it?

We can use the inline script tags and write our javaScript code between them but it can be very painfull if you are writing a lot of javascript code so in this case we can create javaScript file and link them into index.html to link the javaScript file to the website. We can add the script file in the head section or at the end of all your HTML code, what that means it means that your javaScript file will be load after your all html code.
